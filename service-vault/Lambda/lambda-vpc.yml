Description: >
  This AWS CloudFormation Template creates the necessary AWS resources for a Lambda function
  and its associated configurations. It deploys a Lambda function inside a VPC with the
  specified security group and subnet settings, allowing it to interact with resources in
  a secure network environment.
  - Change <Name> To the desired name
  - VpcId: !ImportValue Network:ApplicationVPC imports the values from the file "/VPC/network.yml"
  - It Gives full access to lambda, s3, gives permission to AWSLambdaVPCAccessExecutionRole, and SecretsManagerReadWrite
